# udemy_php-for-complete-beginners-includes-msql-object-oriented

Originally i was following the course; however, i found that a significant portion was behind. 
I decided to follow along superficially and implement the ideas using 
the [slim framework](http://www.slimframework.com/docs/v3/tutorial/first-app.html), eloquent, activerecords, and 
OOP style php rather than procedural.

You may find my partial content management system (CMS) [here](https://github.com/jessequinn/udemy_php-for-complete-beginners-includes-msql-object-oriented/tree/master/Course_Work/CMS/src).

I decided to move the completed CMS to a private repo that i user for my own site.

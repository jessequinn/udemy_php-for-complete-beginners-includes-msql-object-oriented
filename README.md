# udemy_php-for-complete-beginners-includes-msql-object-oriented

Originally i was following the course; however, i found that a significant portion was behind. 
I decided to follow along superficially and implement the ideas using 
the [slim framework](http://www.slimframework.com/docs/v3/tutorial/first-app.html), eloquent, activerecords, and 
OOP style php rather than procedural.
